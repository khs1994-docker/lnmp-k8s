# "io.kubernetes.cri-o.seccompNotifierAction" in the allowed_annotations array.
#
# It also requires at least runc 1.1.0 or crun 0.19 which support the notifier
# feature.
#
# If everything is setup, CRI-O will modify chosen seccomp profiles for
# containers if the annotation "io.kubernetes.cri-o.seccompNotifierAction" is
# set on the Pod sandbox. CRI-O will then get notified if a container is using
# a blocked syscall and then terminate the workload after a timeout of 5
# seconds if the value of "io.kubernetes.cri-o.seccompNotifierAction=stop".
#
# This also means that multiple syscalls can be captured during that period,
# while the timeout will get reset once a new syscall has been discovered.
#
# This also means that the Pods "restartPolicy" has to be set to "Never",
# otherwise the kubelet will restart the container immediately.
#
# Please be aware that CRI-O is not able to get notified if a syscall gets
# blocked based on the seccomp defaultAction, which is a general runtime
